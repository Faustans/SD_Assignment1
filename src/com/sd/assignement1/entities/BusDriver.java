 * This datatype implements the Passenger thread.
 * In his lifecycle, the passenger breaks his car,
 * gets (or not) a replacement car, and gets his
 * car fixed. <p>
 * He follows the following order:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Uses his car until it breaks down;
 * <li> Goes to repair shop and queues in;
 * <li> Asks (or not) the manager for a replacement car;
 * <li> Goes back to work with a replacement car or by bus;
 * <li> After the manager calls, the customer goes back to the shop;
 * <li> Finally the customer pays for the service, and gets the car back.
 * </ul>
